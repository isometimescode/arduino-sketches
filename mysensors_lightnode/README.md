# MySensors Node: BH1750 Sensor

This detects changes in light inside a delivery box where a contact switch isn't as easy to install. It uses a BH1750 light sensor because that's what I had on hand, but it could easily be changed to a motion detector sensor instead.

This also uses a LiPoly battery, so it uses a method to roughly guess the remaining percentage available.
